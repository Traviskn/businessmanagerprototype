This is a mockup prototype of a small business management application.

In order for the navigation links to work, this project must be served by some kind of static web server.  If you happen to have python installed, you can run the following command from your terminal while in this project's directory:

```shell
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
or if you are using python 3:

```shell
$ python3 -m http.server
```
