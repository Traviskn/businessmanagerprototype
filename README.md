**README**

This is a mockup prototype of a small business management application.  It utilizes components of the [materialize css framework](http://materializecss.com/).

In order for the navigation links to work, this project must be served by some kind of static web server.  This app comes with a node.js web server, so if you happen to have node and npm you can use the following commands to run it:

``` shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
